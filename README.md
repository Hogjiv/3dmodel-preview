### 3D Model preview

# created by Hogjiv


Preview Maker is an application designed to simplify the workflow with 3D models downloaded from websites like 3ddd.ru and 3dsky.org.

One of the main problems is that model archives often do not include previews, making it difficult to understand what is inside the archive. Since project deadlines are usually very tight, 3D artists often do not have enough time to manually check each model or find it on the website. In many cases, it is essential to quickly locate a suitable model or propose an idea for using a particular model in a scene. However, before making a decision, it is crucial to discuss options with colleagues or clients.

With Preview Maker, you can scan all the models in a folder and view all previews in one place. This allows you to showcase available options to your colleagues and collaboratively make decisions.
